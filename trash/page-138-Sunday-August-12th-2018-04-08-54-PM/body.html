<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Was there some source of energy greater than chemical energy? What about the energy of motion? Helmholtz suggested that meteors might be falling into the sun at a steady rate. The energy of their collisions might then be converted into heat and light and this could keep the sun shining for as long as the supply of meteors held out&mdash;even millions of years.</p><p>This, however, would mean that the sun&rsquo;s mass would be increasing steadily, and so would the force of its gravitational pull. With the sun&rsquo;s gravitational field increasing steadily, the length of earth&rsquo;s year would be decreasing at a measurable rate&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>In 1854 Helmholtz came up with something better. He suggested that the sun was contracting. Its outermost layers were falling inward, and the energy of this fall was converted into heat and light. What&rsquo;s more, this energy would be obtained without any change in the mass of the sun whatever.</p></div> </div>
