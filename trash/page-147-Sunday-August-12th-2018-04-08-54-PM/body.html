This was first proposed in 1850 by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Emmanuel Clausius (1822-1888) and had proved so useful that physicists did not like to abandon it unless they absolutely had to.</p><p>Another possibility was that radioactive atoms were creating energy out of nothing. This, of course, violated the law of conservation of energy (also called &ldquo;the first law of thermodynamics&rdquo;) and physicists preferred not to do that either.</p><p>The only thing that seemed to remain was to suppose that somewhere within the atom was a source of energy that had never made itself evident to humanity until the discovery of radioactivity. Becquerel was one of the first to suggest this.</p></div> </div>
