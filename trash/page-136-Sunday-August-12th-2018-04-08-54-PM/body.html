<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The most serious problem raised by the law of conservation of energy involved the sun. Until 1847, scientists did not question sunlight. The sun radiated vast quantities of energy but that apparently was its nature and was no more to be puzzled over than the fact that the earth rotated on its axis.</p><p>Once Helmholtz had stated that energy could neither be created nor destroyed, however, he was bound to ask where the sun&rsquo;s energy came from. It had, to man&rsquo;s best knowledge, been radiating heat and light, with no perceptible change, throughout the history of civilization and, from what biologists and geologists could deduce, for countless ages earlier. Where, then, did that energy come from?</p></div> </div>
