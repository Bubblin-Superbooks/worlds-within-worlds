<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Helmholtz calculated that the sun&rsquo;s contraction over the 6000 years of recorded history would have reduced its diameter only 560 miles&mdash;a change that would not have been noticeable to the unaided eye. Since the development of the telescope, two and a half centuries earlier, the decrease in 57 diameter would have been only 23 miles and that was not measurable by the best techniques of Helmholtz&rsquo;s day.</p><p>Working backward, however, it seemed that 25 million years ago, the sun must have been so large as to fill the earth&rsquo;s orbit. Clearly the earth could not then have existed. In that case, the maximum age of the earth was only 25 million years.</p></div> </div>
