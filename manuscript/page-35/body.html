<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The light of the spark, and the crackling sound it makes, are the results of the electric current interacting with molecules of air and heating them. Neither the light nor the sound is the electricity itself. In order to detect the electricity, the current ought to be forced across a gap containing nothing, not even air.</p><p>In order to do that, wires would have to be sealed into a glass tube from which all (or almost all) the air was withdrawn. This was not easy to do and it was not until 1854 that Heinrich Geissler (1814-1879), a German glass-blower and inventor, accomplished this feat. The wires sealed 14 into such a &ldquo;Geissler tube&rdquo; could be attached to the poles of an electric generator, and if enough voltage was built up, the current would leap across the vacuum.</p></div> </div>
