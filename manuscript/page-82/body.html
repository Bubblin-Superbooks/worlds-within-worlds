At least elements with atomic numbers of 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, 87, and 91 were still not known. By 1945, all seven had been discovered.</p><p>It quickly turned out that the atomic number was more fundamental and more characteristic of a particular element than was the atomic weight.</p><p>Niels Bohr</p></div> </div>
