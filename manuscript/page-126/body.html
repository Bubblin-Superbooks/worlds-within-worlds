An oxygen atom might then strike a hydrogen molecule to form water (O + H₂ &rarr; H₂O) and more energy is given off than was 53 absorbed from the match flame. The temperature goes up still higher so that further breakup among the oxygen and hydrogen molecules is encouraged.</p><p>The formation of a sodium chloride molecule.</p><p>This happens over and over again so that in very little time, the temperature is very high and the hydrogen and oxygen are combining to form water at an enormous rate. If a great deal of hydrogen and oxygen are well-mixed to begin with, the rate of reaction is so great that an explosion occurs.</p></div> </div>
