The alpha rays and beta rays, which carried electric charges, seemed to be streams of charged particles (&ldquo;alpha particles&rdquo; and &ldquo;beta particles&rdquo;) just as the cathode rays had turned out to be.</p><p>In 1900, indeed, Becquerel studied the beta particles and found them to be identical in mass and charge with electrons. They were electrons.</p><p>By 1906 Rutherford had worked out the nature of the alpha particles. They carried a positive electric charge that was twice as great as the electron&rsquo;s negative charge. If an electron carried a charge that could be symbolized as -, then the charge of the alpha particle was ++. Furthermore, the alpha particle was much more massive than the electron.</p></div> </div>
