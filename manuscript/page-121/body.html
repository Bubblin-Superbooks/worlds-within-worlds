His work and similar work by others made it clear that such &ldquo;chemical energy&rdquo;&mdash;the energy derived from chemical changes in matter&mdash;fit the law of conservation of energy.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how it looked in the last decades of the 19th century.</p><p>Molecules are composed of combinations of atoms. Within the molecules, the atoms stick together more or less tightly. It takes a certain amount of energy to pull a molecule apart into separate atoms against the resistance of the forces holding them together.</p></div> </div>
