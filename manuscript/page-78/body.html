There was such a close connection, in fact, that Moseley could arrange the elements in order according to the wavelength of the characteristic X rays.</p><p>For some 40 years prior to this, the elements had been listed in order of atomic weight. This was useful especially since the Russian chemist Dmitri I. Mendel&eacute;ev (1834-1907) had arranged them in a &ldquo;periodic table&rdquo; based on the atomic weight order in such a way that elements of similar properties were grouped together. The elements in this table were sometimes numbered consecutively (&ldquo;atomic number&rdquo;) but this was inconvenient since, when new elements were discovered, the list of atomic numbers might have to be reorganized.</p></div> </div>
