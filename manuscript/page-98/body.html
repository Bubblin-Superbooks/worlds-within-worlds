There were two regions of 41 darkening, because there were neon ions of two different masses that curved in two different degrees and ended in two different places. Thomson showed, from the amount of curving, that there was a neon isotope with an atomic weight of 20 and one with an atomic weight of 22&mdash;&sup2;⁰Ne and &sup2;&sup2;Ne.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, from the intensity of darkening, it could be seen that ordinary neon was made up of atoms that were roughly 90% &sup2;⁰Ne and 10% &sup2;&sup2;Ne. The overall atomic weight of neon, 20.2, was the average atomic weight of these 2 isotopes.</p></div> </div>
