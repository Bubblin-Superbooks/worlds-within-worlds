<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As you see, &sup1;⁶O must have a mass number of slightly less than 16.0000 and it must be the more massive isotopes &sup1;⁷O and &sup1;⁸O that pull the average up to 16.0000. Disregarding this, chemists clung to a standard atomic weight of 16.000 for oxygen as it appeared in nature, preferring not to concern themselves with the separate isotopes.</p><p>46</p><p>Physicists, however, felt uneasy at using an average as standard for they were more interested in working with individual isotopes. They preferred to set &sup1;⁶O at 16.0000 so that the average atomic weight of oxygen was 16.0044 and all other atomic weights rose in proportion. Atomic weights determined by this system were &ldquo;physical atomic weights&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
