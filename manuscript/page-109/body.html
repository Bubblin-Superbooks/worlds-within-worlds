<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Finally, in 1961, a compromise was struck. Chemists and physicists alike decided to consider the atomic weight of &sup1;&sup2;C as exactly 12 and to use that as a standard. By this system, the atomic weight of oxygen became 15.9994, which is only very slightly less than 16.</p><p>The radioactive elements did not escape this new view either. The atomic weight of uranium (chemical symbol U) is just about 238 and, indeed, most of its atoms are &sup2;&sup3;⁸U. In 1935, however, the Canadian-American physicist, Arthur Jeffrey Dempster (1886-1950), found that 0.7% of its atoms were a lighter isotope, &sup2;&sup3;⁵U.</p><p>These differed considerably in radioactive properties. The common uranium isotope, &sup2;&sup3;⁸U, had a half-life of 4500 million years, while &sup2;&sup3;⁵U had a half-life of only 700 million years. Furthermore &sup2;&sup3;⁵U broke down in three stages to actinium. It was &sup2;&sup3;⁵U, not actinium itself, that was the beginning of the actinium radioactive series.</p></div> </div>
