<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As for ordinary lead in nonradioactive rocks, it is made up of 23.6% &sup2;⁰⁶Pb, 22.6% &sup2;⁰⁷Pb, and 52.3% &sup2;⁰⁸Pb. There is still a fourth isotope, &sup2;⁰⁴Pb, which makes up the remaining 1.5% and which is not the product of any radioactive series at all.</p><p>The isotopes always have atomic weights that are close to, but not quite, whole numbers. Any atomic weight of an element that departs appreciably from an integer does so only because it is an average of different isotopes. For instance, the atomic weight of chlorine (chemical symbol Cl) is 35.5, but this is because it is made up of a mixture of 2 isotopes. About one quarter of chlorine&rsquo;s atoms are &sup3;⁷Cl and about three-quarters are &sup3;⁵Cl.</p></div> </div>
