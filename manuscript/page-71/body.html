<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>According to Rutherford&rsquo;s notion, the atom consisted of a single tiny positively charged lead shot at the center of a foam of electrons. It was Thomson&rsquo;s notion in reverse. Still, the nucleus carried a positive charge of a particular size and was balanced by negatively charged electrons. Rutherford&rsquo;s 30 model of the atom explained the existence of ions just as easily as Thomson&rsquo;s did and it explained more besides.</p><p>For instance, if all the electrons are removed so that only the nucleus remains, this nucleus is as massive as an atom but is so tiny in size that it can penetrate matter. The alpha particle would be a bare atomic nucleus from this point of view.</p></div> </div>
