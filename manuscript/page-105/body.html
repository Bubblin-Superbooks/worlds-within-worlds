<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>44</p><p>Sometimes the atomic weight of an element, as it occurs in nature, is nearly a whole number and yet it is made up of more than 1 isotope. In that case, one of the isotopes makes up very nearly all of it, while the others are present in such minor quantities that the average is hardly affected.</p><p>Helium, for instance (atomic symbol He) has an atomic weight of just about 4 and, indeed, almost all the atoms making it up are ⁴He. However, 0.0001% of the atoms, or one out of a million, are &sup3;He. Again, 99.6% of all the nitrogen atoms (atomic symbol N) are &sup1;⁴N, but 0.4% are &sup1;⁵N. Then, 98.9% of all carbon atoms (atomic symbol C) are &sup1;&sup2;C, but 1.1% are &sup1;&sup3;C. It is not surprising that the atomic weights of nitrogen and carbon are just about 14 and 12, respectively.</p></div> </div>
