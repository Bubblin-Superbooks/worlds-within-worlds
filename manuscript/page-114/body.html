<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We have now gone as far as we conveniently can in considering the intertwining strands of the atom and of electricity. It is time to turn to the third strand&mdash;energy.</p><p>To physicists the concept of &ldquo;work&rdquo; is that of exerting a force on a body and making it move through some distance. To lift a weight against the pull of gravity is work. To drive a nail into wood against the friction of its fibers is work.</p><p>Anything capable of performing work is said to possess &ldquo;energy&rdquo; from Greek words meaning &ldquo;work within&rdquo;. There are various forms of energy. Any moving mass possesses energy by virtue of its motion. That is, a moving hammer will drive a nail into wood, while the same hammer held motionlessly against the nailhead will not do so.</p></div> </div>
