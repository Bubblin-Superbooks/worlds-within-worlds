The integer closest to the mass of the individual isotope is spoken of as the &ldquo;mass number&rdquo; of that isotope. Thus, chlorine is made up of isotopes with mass numbers 35 and 37, but the atomic weight of chlorine as it is found in nature is 35.5 (or, to be more accurate, 35.453).</p></div> </div>
