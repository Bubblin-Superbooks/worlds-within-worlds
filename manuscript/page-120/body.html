<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In that same year, the German physicist Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821-1894) advanced the general notion that a fixed amount of energy in one form was equal to the same amount of energy in any other form. Energy might change its form over and over, but not change its amount. None could either be destroyed or created. This is the &ldquo;law of conservation of energy&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
