Sometimes it even bounced directly backward. It was as though somewhere in each atom there was something at least as massive as the alpha particle.</p><p>How large was this massive portion of the atom? It couldn&rsquo;t be very large for if it were the alpha particles would hit it frequently. Instead, the alpha particles made very few hits. This meant the massive portion was very small and that most alpha particles tore through the atom without coming anywhere near it.</p><p>Rutherford&rsquo;s alpha particle bombardment apparatus.
