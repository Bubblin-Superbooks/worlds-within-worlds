<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>An electric current flows through a closed circuit of some conducting material, such as metal wires. It starts at one pole of a battery, or of some other electricity generating device, and ends at the other. The two poles are the positive pole or &ldquo;anode&rdquo; and the negative pole or &ldquo;cathode&rdquo;.</p><p>If there is a break in the circuit, the current will usually not flow at all. If, however, the break is not a large one, and the current is under a high driving force (which is called the &ldquo;voltage&rdquo;), then the current may leap across the break. If two ends of a wire, making up part of a broken circuit, are brought close to each other with nothing but air between, a spark may leap across the narrowing gap before they actually meet and, while it persists, the current will flow despite the break.</p></div> </div>
