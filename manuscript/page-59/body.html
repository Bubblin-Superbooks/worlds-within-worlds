<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Since radioactive atoms gave off either positively charged particles or negatively charged particles, it seemed reasonable to assume that atoms generally were made up of both types of electricity. Furthermore, since the atoms in matter generally carried no charge at all, the normal &ldquo;neutral atom&rdquo; must be made up of equal quantities of positive charge and negative charge.</p><p>It turned out that only radioactive atoms, such as those of uranium and thorium, gave off positively charged alpha particles. Many atoms, however, that were not radioactive, could be made to give off electrons. In 1899 Thomson showed that certain perfectly normal metals with no trace of radioactivity gave off electrons when exposed to ultraviolet light. (This is called the &ldquo;photoelectric effect&rdquo;.)</p></div> </div>
