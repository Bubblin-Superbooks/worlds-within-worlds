<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Such a situation, in which each reacting bit of the system adds energy to the system by its reaction and brings about more reactions like itself, is called a &ldquo;chain reaction&rdquo;. Thus, a match flame put to one corner of a large sheet of paper will set that corner burning. The heat of the burning will ignite a 54 neighboring portion of the sheet and so on till the entire sheet is burned. For that matter a single smoldering cigarette end can serve to burn down an entire forest in a vastly destructive chain reaction.</p></div> </div>
