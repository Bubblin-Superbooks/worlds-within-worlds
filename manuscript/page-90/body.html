Another way of saying this (which was introduced by Rutherford) was that the &ldquo;half-life&rdquo; of uranium X₁, is 24 days. Ordinary thorium, however, gives off alpha particles, not beta particles, and does so at such a slow rate, that its half-life is 14 billion years!</p><p>Uranium X₁, and ordinary thorium were in the same place in the list of elements by chemical standards, and yet there was clearly something different about the two.</p><p>Here is another case. In 1913 the British chemist Alexander Fleck (1889- ) studied &ldquo;radium B&rdquo; and &ldquo;radium D&rdquo;, the names given to two different kinds of atoms in the uranium radioactive series.</p></div> </div>
