<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ordinary thorium, however, gives off alpha particles, not beta particles, and does so at such a slow rate, that its half-life is 14 billion years!</p><p>Uranium X‚ÇÅ, and ordinary thorium were in the same place in the list of elements by chemical standards, and yet there was clearly something different about the two.</p><p>Here is another case. In 1913 the British chemist Alexander Fleck (1889- ) studied &ldquo;radium B&rdquo; and &ldquo;radium D&rdquo;, the names given to two different kinds of atoms in the uranium radioactive series. He also studied &ldquo;thorium B&rdquo; in the thorium radioactive series and &ldquo;actinium B&rdquo; in the actinium radioactive series. All four are chemically the same as ordinary lead; all four are in the same place in the list of elements. Yet each is different from the radioactive standpoint.</p></div> </div>
