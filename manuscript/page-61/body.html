In that case, the net charge of the atom as a whole would be +1. On the other hand, if an extra electron were forced onto the atom, the charge of +5 would be balanced by 6 electrons with a total charge of -6, and the net charge of the atom as a whole would be -1.</p><p>Such electrically charged atoms were called &ldquo;ions&rdquo; and their existence had been suspected since Faraday&rsquo;s day. Faraday had known that atoms had to travel through a solution under the influence of an electric field to account for the way in which metals and gases appeared at the cathode and anode. It was he who first used the term, ion, from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;traveller&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
