<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If it were some variety of this newly discovered source of energy (not necessarily ordinary radioactivity, of course) that powered the sun&mdash;millions of times as intense as chemical energy&mdash;then the sun might be pouring out energy for hundreds of millions of years without perceptible physical change&mdash;just as uranium would show scarcely any change even in so mighty a time span. The sun would not have to be contracting; it would not have had to fill the earth&rsquo;s orbit 25,000,000 years ago.</p><p>This was all exciting, but in 1900 the structure of the atom had not yet been worked out and this new energy was just a vague supposition. No one had any idea of what it actually might be or where in the atom it might be located. It could only be spoken of as existing &ldquo;within the atom&rdquo; and was therefore called &ldquo;atomic energy&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
