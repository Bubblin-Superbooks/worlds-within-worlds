<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For some 40 years prior to this, the elements had been listed in order of atomic weight. This was useful especially since the Russian chemist Dmitri I. Mendel&eacute;ev (1834-1907) had arranged them in a &ldquo;periodic table&rdquo; based on the atomic weight order in such a way that elements of similar properties were grouped together. The elements in this table were sometimes numbered consecutively (&ldquo;atomic number&rdquo;) but this was inconvenient since, when new elements were discovered, the list of atomic numbers might have to be reorganized.</p><p>Dmitri Mendel&eacute;ev and Bohuslav Brauner in Prague in 1900. Brauner was a professor of chemistry at the Bohemian University in Prague.</p><p>The Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962) had just advanced a theory of atomic structure that made it reasonable to suppose that the wavelength of the characteristic X rays depended on the size of the nuclear charge of the atoms making up a particular element.</p></div> </div>
