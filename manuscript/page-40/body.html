On his right are early X-ray pictures.</p><p>This view of the cathode rays as consisting of a stream of electrically charged particles was confirmed by another English physicist, Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940). In 1897 he showed that the cathode rays could also be made to take a curved path in the presence of electrically charged 16 objects. The particles making up the cathode rays were charged with negative electricity, judging from the direction in which they were made to curve by electrically charged objects.</p><p>Thomson had no hesitation in maintaining that these particles carried the units of electricity that Faraday&rsquo;s work had hinted at. Eventually, Stoney&rsquo;s name for the units of electricity was applied to the particles that carried those units. The cathode rays, in other words, were considered to be made up of streams of electrons and Thomson is usually given credit for having discovered the electron.</p></div> </div>
