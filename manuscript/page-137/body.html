<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>56</p><p>The sun gave the appearance of being a huge globe of fire. Could it actually be that&mdash;a large heap of burning fuel, turning chemical energy into heat and light?</p><p>The sun&rsquo;s mass was known and its rate of energy production was known. Suppose the sun&rsquo;s mass were a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen and it were burning at a rate sufficient to produce the energy at the rate it was giving it off. If that were so, all the hydrogen and oxygen in its mass would be consumed in 1500 years. No chemical reaction in the sun could account for its having given us heat and light since the days of the pyramids, let alone since the days of the dinosaurs.</p></div> </div>
