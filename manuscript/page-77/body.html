<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In 1913 another English physicist, Henry Gwyn-Jeffreys Moseley (1887-1915), went into the matter more thoroughly. He measured the exact wavelength of the characteristic X rays by reflecting them from certain crystals. In crystals, atoms are arranged in regular order and at known distances from each other. X rays reflecting from (or more accurately, diffracting from) crystals are bent out of their path by the rows of atoms. The longer their waves, the more they are bent. From the degree of bending the wavelength of the waves can be determined.</p><p>Charles Glover Barkla</p><p>Henry Gwyn-Jeffreys Moseley</p><p>Moseley found that the greater the atomic weight of an atom, the shorter the waves of the characteristic X rays associated with it and the more penetrating those X rays were. There was such a close connection, in fact, that Moseley could arrange the elements in order according to the wavelength of the characteristic X rays.</p></div> </div>
