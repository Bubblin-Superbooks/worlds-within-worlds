Nowadays we know the relationship quite exactly. We know that it would take 1837.11 electrons to possess the mass of a single hydrogen atom. The electron is therefore a &ldquo;subatomic particle&rdquo;; the first of this sort to be discovered.</p><p>In 1897, then, two types of mass-containing particles were known. There were the atoms, which made up ordinary matter, and the electrons, which made up electric current.</p><p>17</p></div> </div>
