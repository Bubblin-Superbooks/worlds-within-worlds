The supply in uranium and thorium leaked slightly, so to speak, and that was all that made them different.</p><p>The room in which the Curies discovered radium.

As early as 1899 the American geologist Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin (1843-1928) was already speculating about a possible connection between radioactivity and the sun&rsquo;s energy.</p></div> </div>
