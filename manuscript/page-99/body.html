<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thomson&rsquo;s instrument was the first one capable of separating isotopes and such instruments came to be called &ldquo;mass spectrometers&rdquo;. The first to use the name was the English physicist Francis William Aston (1877-1945), who built the first efficient instrument of this type in 1919.</p><p>He used it to study as many elements as he could. He and those who followed him located many isotopes and determined the frequency of their occurrence with considerable precision. It turned out, for instance, that neon is actually 90.9% &sup2;‚Å∞Ne, and 8.8% &sup2;&sup2;Ne. Very small quantities of still a third isotope, &sup2;&sup1;Ne, are also present, making up 0.3%.</p></div> </div>
