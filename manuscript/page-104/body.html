For instance, the gas fluorine (chemical symbol F) has an atomic weight of nearly 19, while that of the metal sodium (chemical symbol Na) is nearly 23. As it turns out, all the atoms of fluorine are of the single variety &sup1;‚ÅπF, while all the atoms of sodium are &sup2;&sup3;Na.</p></div> </div>
