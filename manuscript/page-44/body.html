In 1897, when the electron was discovered, a line of research that was to tie the two kinds of particles together had already begun.</p><p>In 1895 the German physicist Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen (1845-1923) was working with cathode rays. He found that if he made the cathode rays strike the glass at the other end of the tube, a kind of radiation was produced. This radiation was capable of penetrating glass and other matter. Roentgen had no idea as to the nature of the radiation, and so called it &ldquo;X rays&rdquo;. This name, containing &ldquo;X&rdquo; for &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;, was retained even after physicists worked out the nature of X rays and found them to be light-like radiation made up of waves much shorter than those of ordinary light.</p></div> </div>
