<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A Geissler tube.</p><p>Such experiments were first performed by the German physicist Julius Pl&uuml;cker (1801-1868). In 1858 he noticed that when the current flowed across the vacuum there was a greenish glow about the wire that was attached to the cathode of the generator. Others studied this glow and finally the German physicist Eugen Goldstein (1850-1931) decided in 1876 that there were rays of some sort beginning at the wire attached to the negatively charged cathode and ending at the part of the tube opposite the cathode. He called them &ldquo;cathode rays&rdquo;.</p><p>These cathode rays, it seemed, might well be the electric current itself, freed from the metal wires that usually carried it. If so, determining the nature of the cathode rays might reveal a great deal about the nature of the electric current.</p></div> </div>
