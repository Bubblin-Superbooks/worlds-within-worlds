The American chemist Harold Clayton Urey (1893- ) detected the existence of a 45 more massive isotope, &sup2;H. This isotope has almost twice the mass of the lighter one. No other isotopes of a particular atom differ in mass by so large a factor. For that reason &sup2;H and &sup1;H differ in ordinary chemical properties more than isotopes usually do and Urey therefore gave &sup2;H the special name of &ldquo;deuterium&rdquo; from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;second&rdquo;.</p><p>W. F. Giauque</p><p>In 1929 the American chemist William Francis Giauque (1895- ) found that oxygen was composed of more than 1 isotope. Its atomic weight had been set arbitrarily at 16.0000 so it was a relief that 99.76% of its atoms were &sup1;⁶O. However, 0.20% were &sup1;⁸O, and 0.04% were &sup1;⁷O.</p></div> </div>
