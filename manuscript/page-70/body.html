Below, alpha particles are shown bouncing off a nucleus in the gold foil.</p><p>By 1911 Rutherford announced his results to the world. He suggested that just about all the mass of the atom was concentrated into a very tiny, positively charged &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo; at its center. The diameter of the nucleus was only about 1/10,000 the diameter of the atom. All the rest of the atom was filled with the very light electrons.</p><p>Hans Geiger (left) and Ernest Rutherford at Manchester University about 1910.</p></div> </div>
