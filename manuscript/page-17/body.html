<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As long ago as ancient Greek times, there were men who suspected that all matter consisted of tiny particles which were far too small to see. Under ordinary circumstances, they could not be divided into anything smaller, and they were called &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;indivisible&rdquo;.</p><p>It was not until 1808, however, that this &ldquo;atomic theory&rdquo; was really put on a firm foundation. In that year the English chemist John Dalton (1766-1844) published a book in which he discussed atoms in detail. Every element, he suggested, was made up of its own type of atoms. The atoms of one element were different from the atoms of every other element. The chief difference between the various atoms lay in their mass, or weight.</p></div> </div>
