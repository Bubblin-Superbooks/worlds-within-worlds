All four are chemically the same as ordinary lead; all four are in the same place in the list of elements. Yet each is different from the radioactive standpoint. Though all give off beta particles, radium B has a 38 half-life of 27 minutes, radium D one of 19 years, thorium B one of 11 hours, and actinium B one of 36 minutes.</p><p>In 1913 Soddy called atoms that were in the same place in the list of elements, but which had different radioactive properties, &ldquo;isotopes&rdquo;, from Greek words meaning &ldquo;same place&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
