One carried a positive charge of electricity, one a negative charge, and one no charge at all. The New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) called the first two kinds of radiation &ldquo;alpha rays&rdquo; and &ldquo;beta rays&rdquo;, after the first two letters of the Greek alphabet.
