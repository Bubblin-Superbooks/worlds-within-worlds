<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Helium, with an atomic number of 2, has a nuclear charge of +2 and 2 electrons, with a total charge of -2, to balance it. (The alpha particle released by radioactive atoms is identical with a helium nucleus.)</p><p>The atomic number increases as one goes up the line of atoms. Oxygen atoms, for instance, have an atomic number of 8 and iron atoms have one of 26. At the upper end, thorium is 90 and uranium is 92. Each uranium atom has a nucleus bearing a charge of +92 and contains 92 electrons to balance this.</p><p>Once the notion of the atomic number was worked out, it became possible to tell for certain whether any elements remained as yet undiscovered and, if so, where in the list they might be.</p></div> </div>
