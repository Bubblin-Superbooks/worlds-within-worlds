<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The same was true of thorium (atomic number 90), which began a series that also ended with lead. Still a third element, actinium (atomic number 89) was, at that time, the first known member of a series that also ended in lead.</p><p>The various atoms formed in these three radioactive series were not all different in every way. When the uranium atom gives off an alpha particle, it forms an atom originally called &ldquo;uranium X₁&rdquo;. On close investigation, it turned out that this uranium X₁ had the chemical properties of thorium. Uranium X₁, had, however, radioactive properties different from ordinary thorium.</p><p>Uranium X₁ broke down so rapidly, giving off beta particles as it did so, that half of any given quantity would have broken down in 24 days. Another way of saying this (which was introduced by Rutherford) was that the &ldquo;half-life&rdquo; of uranium X₁, is 24 days.</p></div> </div>
