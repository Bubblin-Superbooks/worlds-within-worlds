<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Once uranium was discovered to be an endless source of radiation, it gained interest that has risen ever since. Madame Curie gave the name &ldquo;radioactivity&rdquo; to this phenomenon of continuously giving off rays. Uranium was the first element found to be radioactive.</p><p>It did not remain alone, however. It was soon shown that thorium was also radioactive. Thorium, which had been discovered in 1829 by Berzelius, was made up of atoms that were the second most massive known at the time. Thorium&rsquo;s atomic weight is 232.</p><p>But what was the mysterious radiation emitted by uranium and thorium?</p><p>Almost at once it was learned that whatever the radiation was, it was not uniform in properties. In 1899 Becquerel (and others) showed that, in the presence of a magnet, some of the radiation swerved in a particular direction. Later it was found that a portion of it swerved in the opposite direction. Still another part didn&rsquo;t swerve at all but moved on in a straight line.</p></div> </div>
