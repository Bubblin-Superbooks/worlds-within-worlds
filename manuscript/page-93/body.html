<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The uranium series ought to end with lead atoms that had an atomic weight of 206. The thorium series ought to end in lead atoms with an atomic weight of 208 and the actinium series in lead atoms with an atomic weight of 207.</p><p>If this were so, there would be 3 lead isotopes that would differ not in radioactive properties, but in atomic weight. The isotopes could be referred to as lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208. If we use the chemical symbol for lead (Pb), we could write the isotopes, &sup2;⁰⁶Pb, &sup2;⁰⁷Pb, and &sup2;⁰⁸Pb. (We read the symbol &sup2;⁰⁶Pb as lead-206.) Atomic weight measurements made in 1914 by Soddy and others supported that theory.</p></div> </div>
