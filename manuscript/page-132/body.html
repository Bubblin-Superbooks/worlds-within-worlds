<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus, the helium atom has 2 electrons only, filling the innermost shell, and that is so stable an arrangement that helium undergoes no chemical reactions at all. The neon atom has 10 electrons&mdash;2 in the innermost shell, and 8 in the next&mdash;and it does not react. The argon atom has 18 electrons&mdash;2, 8, and 8&mdash;and it too is very stable.</p><p>But what if an atom did not have its electron shell so neatly filled. The sodium atom has 11 electrons&mdash;2, 8, and 1&mdash;while the fluorine atom has 9 electrons&mdash;2 and 7. If the sodium atom passed one of its electrons to a fluorine atom, both would have the stable configuration of neon&mdash;2 and 8. This, therefore, ought to have a great tendency to happen.</p></div> </div>
