None was either created or destroyed, however, the nature of the matter might change. This was called the &ldquo;law of conservation of mass&rdquo;.</p><p>Lavoisier in his laboratory during his studies on respiration. From a sketch made by Madame Lavoisier.</p><p>Antoine Lavoisier and his wife.</p><p>Naturally, it would occur to scientists to wonder if a similar law might hold for energy. The answer wasn&rsquo;t easy to get. It wasn&rsquo;t as simple to measure the quantity of energy as it was to measure the quantity of mass. Nor was it as simple to pen up a quantity of energy and keep it from escaping or from gaining additional quantity from outside, as it was in the case of mass.</p></div> </div>
