He could not work out the actual masses in ounces or grams, for atoms were far too tiny to weigh with any of his instruments. He could, however, determine their relative weights; that is, how much more massive one kind of atom might be than another.</p><p>For instance, he found that a quantity of hydrogen gas invariably combined with eight times its own mass of oxygen gas to form water. He guessed that water consisted of combinations of 1 atom of hydrogen with 1 atom of oxygen. (A combination of atoms is called a &ldquo;molecule&rdquo; from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;a small mass&rdquo;, and so hydrogen and oxygen atoms can be said to combine to form a &ldquo;water molecule&rdquo;.)</p></div> </div>
