<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Since the atom consisted of a positively charged nucleus at the center, and a number of negatively charged electrons outside, the next step was to find the exact size of the nuclear charge and the exact number of electrons for the different varieties of atoms.</p><p>The answer came through a line of research that began with the English physicist Charles Glover Barkla (1877-1944). In 1911 he noted that when X rays passed through atoms, some were absorbed and some bounced back. Those that bounced back had a certain ability to penetrate other matter. When the X rays struck atoms of high atomic weight, the X rays that bounced back were particularly penetrating. In fact, each different type of atom seemed associated with reflected X rays of a particular penetrating power, so Barkla called these &ldquo;characteristic X rays&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
