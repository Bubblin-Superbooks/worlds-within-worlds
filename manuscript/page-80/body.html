Brauner was a professor of chemistry at the Bohemian University in Prague.</p><p>33</p><p>The Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962) had just advanced a theory of atomic structure that made it reasonable to suppose that the wavelength of the characteristic X rays depended on the size of the nuclear charge of the atoms making up a particular element. Moseley therefore suggested that these X rays be used to determine the size of the positive charge on its nucleus. The atomic number could then be set equal to that charge and be made independent of new discoveries of elements.</p><p>Hydrogen, for instance, has an atomic number of 1. Its nucleus carries a unit positive charge, +1, and the hydrogen atom possesses 1 electron to balance this.</p></div> </div>
