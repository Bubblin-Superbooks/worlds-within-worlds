The atomic number could then be set equal to that charge and be made independent of new discoveries of elements.</p><p>Hydrogen, for instance, has an atomic number of 1. Its nucleus carries a unit positive charge, +1, and the hydrogen atom possesses 1 electron to balance this. Helium, with an atomic number of 2, has a nuclear charge of +2 and 2 electrons, with a total charge of -2, to balance it. (The alpha particle released by radioactive atoms is identical with a helium nucleus.)</p><p>The atomic number increases as one goes up the line of atoms. Oxygen atoms, for instance, have an atomic number of 8 and iron atoms have one of 26. At the upper end, thorium is 90 and uranium is 92. Each uranium atom has a nucleus bearing a charge of +92 and contains 92 electrons to balance this.</p></div> </div>
