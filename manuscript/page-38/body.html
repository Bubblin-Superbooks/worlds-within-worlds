<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Were cathode rays something like light and were they made up of tiny waves? Or were they a stream of particles possessing mass?</p><p>There were physicists on each side of the question. By 1885, however, the English physicist William Crookes 15 (1832-1919) showed that cathode rays could be made to turn a small wheel when they struck that wheel on one side. This seemed to show that the cathode rays possessed mass and were a stream of atom-like particles, rather than a beam of mass-less light. Furthermore, Crookes showed that the cathode rays could be pushed sideways in the presence of a magnet. (This effect, when current flows in a wire, is what makes a motor work.) This meant that, unlike either light or ordinary atoms, the cathode rays carried an electric charge.</p></div> </div>
