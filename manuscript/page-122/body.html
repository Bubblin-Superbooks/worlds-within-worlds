<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is energy in a piece of wood. Left quietly to itself, it seems completely incapable of bringing about any kind of work. Set it on fire, however, and the wood plus the oxygen in the air will give off heat and light that are clearly forms of energy. The heat could help boil water and run a steam engine.</p><p>51</p><p>The amount of energy in burning wood could be measured if it were mixed with air and allowed to burn in a closed container that was immersed in a known quantity of water. From the rise in temperature of the water, the quantity of energy produced could be measured in units called &ldquo;calories&rdquo; (from a Latin word for &ldquo;heat&rdquo;). The instrument was therefore called a &ldquo;calorimeter&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
